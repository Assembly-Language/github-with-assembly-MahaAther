remarks about sum-even
- Calculates the sum of even numbers in an array.
- Counts the number of even numbers in the array.
- Displays the sum and count of even numbers.


remarks about sum-odd
1. The program calculates the sum and count of odd numbers in the given array.
2. The array is initialized with 8 signed words: -3, -6, -1, -10, 10, 30, 40, 4.
3. The sum and count variables are initialized to 0.
4. The program uses a loop to iterate through the array, checking each number to see if it's odd using the test ax, 1h instruction.
5. If a number is odd, its value is added to the sum variable, and the count variable is incremented.
6. After the loop, the program displays the sum and count of odd numbers using the writestring and writeint procedures.
remarks about sum-pos

Overall remarks 
In these task we check number is even,odd,positive and negative by using test command
then we calculate sum of positive,negative,odd and even numbers
then we count how many even,odd,positive and negative number in an array
